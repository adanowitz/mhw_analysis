### Goal
Compare Y1.5 mhw screens (during Covid) vs Y1 screens (preCovid) for significant differences

### Data
152 students from 8 different colleges, Daytona, Prescott, Iowa, SDSU, SJSU, Cal Poly, Milwaukee, and Boulder, responded to the survey both before Covid and during Covid. Therefore, we are able to conduct 2-sample tests for equality of proportions, which is used to compare two proportions from two different groups to see if there is a significant difference between the proportion of students who had a positive screen from each group (precovid and during covid). It is important to note we need to use proportions since some students did not answer certain questions, and the sample size is different for each screen we look at. 

We also looked at the demographics of the students and computed correlations between the demographics and the Y1.5 (during covid) screens to see if certain groups statistically significantly screened positive or negative.

## 2-Sample Test for Equality of Proportions
#This test is used to compare two proportions from two different groups(precovid and Y1.5) to see if there is a significant difference between the proportion of students who had a positive screen from each group.
prop.test(x=c(37,25), n=c(135,145), alternative = "two.sided", correct = FALSE)
```

During Covid has a higher proportion of students screening as positive for PTSD. With a small p-value of 0.041 the proportions are statistically different.

### Summary 

The Pearson correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A value closer to 0 suggests a weak relationship between the variables.

Looking at the p-values, the correlations that are less than 0.05 are age and other depressive disorders, sexuality and major psychological distress from kessler instrument (kessler major), sexuality and major depressive disorder, international or US and panic disorder, and college and major psychological distress from kessler instrument (kessler major). This means all of their correlations are statistically significant and certain groups from these demographics do tend to screen a certain way to the corresponding disorder, even if the correlation is low. 

***Correlation between Age and Other Depressive Disorder***

The correlation is 0.18, which is a weak relationship between age and other depressive disorder but it is still statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is (0.016,0.342).  

***Correlation between Sexuality and Major Psychological Distress from Kessler Instrument***

The correlation is 0.22, which is a weak relationship between sexuality and kessler major but it is still statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is (0.051,0.37).

***Correlation between Sexuality and Major Depressive Disorder***

The correlation is 0.18, which is a weak relationship between sexuality and major depressive disorder but it is still statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is (0.016,0.342).

***Correlation between International or US Panic Disorder***

The correlation is -0.22, which is a weak NEGATIVE relationship between international or US and panic disorder but it is still statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is (-0.38,-0.044).

***Correlation between College and Major Psychological Distress from Kessler Instrument***

The correlation is 0.23, which is a weak relationship between college and kessler major but it is still statistically significant. The 95% confidence interval is (0.067,0.38).
